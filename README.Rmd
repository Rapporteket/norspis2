# norspis2

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of norspis2 is to make standardized plots, tables and documents, that fits the norms of Norwegian medical quality registries.

## Installation

This package is made for use in Norwegian Quality Registry for Eating Disorders (NorSpis), 
and has little utility outside the ecosystem of Norwegian medical quality registries. 
Still we aim to make the functions so that is should be possible for anyone to input standardized anonymous/summary 
data frames to the plot and table functions, and get plots and tables on our standardized format.  

You can install the released version/development version of norspis2 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Rapporteket/norspis2")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(norspis2)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
