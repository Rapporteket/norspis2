# colors
Some of the standard colors other national medical quality registries use are, given by their HEX codes, as follows:

#084594 
#2171b5 
#6baed6
#c6dbef

You can also retrieve these colors from the rapFigurer package that many national registries use and norspis2 also use, but plan to phase out.  
```{r}
rapFigurer::figtype()$farger

```
